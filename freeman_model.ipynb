    "The Freeman model classifies gentrification as occurring an area where the median household income and share of housing built in the prior 20 years are both less than the metro-area values. For an area to be gentrified, the share of residents with college degrees also has to be greater than the metro value, and there needs to be an increase in house prices.\n",

    "* Median household income (approximate using yearly median earnings - assume proportionality)\n",
    "* Housing supply\n",
    "* Degree equivalent qualifications\n",
